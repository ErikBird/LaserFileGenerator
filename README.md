# Laser File Generator
This software aims to generate vector files as input-templates for leather products produced with a laser cutter. 
These templates are available: 
* Glasses-cover
* Wallets (2 Designs)

The Dynamic files can be adjusted with parameters to fit the specific needs. But you can personalize all products with your name.
